# Connect Nonconsecutive Elements in Auto-Layout

In Auto-Layout, elements on the canvas are spaced and connected automatically. To connect elements that arenâ€™t automatically connected, use a Go To connector.

1.  To change a connector to a Go To connector, directly after the element that you want to connect from, hover over ![Add element](../images/flow_builder_small_circle_icon.png) and click ![../images/flow_builder_new_plus_sign_icon.png](images/flow_autolayout_addnode_icon.png).

2.  Click **Connect to element**.

3.  Click ![the Select Element node](images/flow_select_element_icon.png) on the element that you want to connect to.
