# Distribute Flows to Users Outside Your Org

Let external users run your flow by adding the flow to an Experience Builder site, an external app or page, or an Embedded Service deployment. For finer control over how your flow behaves in external contexts, use a custom Aura component or Visualforce page. Flows in custom Aura components use Lightning runtime, and flows in Visualforce pages use Classic runtime.

For example, set up a self-service tool for your site to help visitors generate custom sales quotes.

Let external users run your flow by adding the flow to a Visualforce page and distributing that page externally. For example, through a community.
-   **[Add a Flow to Your Website Using Embedded Service](../flow/flow_distribute_external_snapin.md)**  
Embedded flows help your users complete simple, automated tasks from within your website. They're even guest user-friendlyâ€”no login required. Simply create your flow using Flow Builder and add it to an Embedded Service deployment.
