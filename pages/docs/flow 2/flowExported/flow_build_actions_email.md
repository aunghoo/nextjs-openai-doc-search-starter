# Options for Sending Emails from a Flow

To send an email from your flow, either use an existing email alert or create the email in the flow.

[Use an Email Alert with an Email Alert Action](flow_ref_elements_emailalert.md)
:   Send an email by using an existing email alert that specifies the email content and recipients. The flow provides only the record ID to use for the email alert.

[Create an Email in a Flow with the Send Email Action](flow_ref_elements_actions_sendemail.md)
:   Send and optionally log an email by specifying the email content and recipients in a flow.
