# Move a Single Element in Auto-Layout

You can’t directly move elements in auto-layout. So, to change a single element’s location, cut the element, and then paste it to its new location.

1.  Click the element that you want to move.

2.  Select **Cut Element**.

3.  Where you want to place the element, hover over ![Add element](../images/flow_builder_small_circle_icon.png) and click ![Add element](../images/flow_builder_new_plus_sign_icon.png), and then click ![paste](images/flow_paste_icon.png) to paste.


When cutting a Decision or Pause element, you can leave the elements from an outcome or configuration path on the canvas after cutting. To keep elements from a path on the canvas, select the path in the cut element panel. To cut a Decision or Pause element and all of its paths, select **None, cut all paths.** from the cut element panel.
