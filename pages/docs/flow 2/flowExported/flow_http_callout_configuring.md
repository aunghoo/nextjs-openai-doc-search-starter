# Configuring an HTTP Callout Action

Connect Flow Builder to an HTTP-based API without using code. To establish a connection between the API and Salesforce, you create an external credential and a named credential in Setup. Then, HTTP Callout guides you through describing the functionality of your API and the endpoint that youâ€™re connecting to. Based on the information that you enter, Flow Builder generates an external service with a corresponding invocable action that you can use across Salesforce.

Before you configure an HTTP Callout action within Flow Builder, set up a named credential to authenticate calls to the external system. From Setup, follow these guidelines to create a permission set, auth provider, external credential, and named credential, in that order. Then grant users access to the User Credentials object.
