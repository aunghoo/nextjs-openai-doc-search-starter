# Distribute a Flow

Once you’ve designed and tested your flow, it’s time to put it to work! Flows can be executed in several ways, depending on who the flow is designed for. Internal users, external users, or systems can run a flow, or a flow can be deployed for another organization.

-   **[Internal Users](../flow/flow_distribute_internal.md)**  

-   **[Distribute Flows to Users Outside Your Org](../flow/flow_distribute_external.md)**  
Let external users run your flow by adding the flow to an Experience Builder site, an external app or page, or an Embedded Service deployment. For finer control over how your flow behaves in external contexts, use a custom Aura component or Visualforce page. Flows in custom Aura components use Lightning runtime, and flows in Visualforce pages use Classic runtime.
-   **[Distribute Flows to Automated Systems](../flow/flow_distribute_system.md)**  
Some flows don’t require any user interaction to start. To enable a system to automatically launch a flow, use the `start` Apex method, a process, or a workflow action.
