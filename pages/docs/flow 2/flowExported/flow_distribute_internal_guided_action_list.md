# Add a Flow to the Actions & Recommendations Component

Want to use your flow to guide users through complex business processes in Lightning console or standard navigation apps? Associate the flow with records by using a process to create a RecordAction object, or by creating an Actions & Recommendations deployment. Then add the Actions & Recommendations component to your Lightning pages using the Lightning App Builder.

When users open a record with this component, they can launch flows and other actions from the list. The flows start in a subtab in a console app, or in a popup window in a standard navigation app. The Actions & Recommendations component is great for call scripts or chat interactions.
