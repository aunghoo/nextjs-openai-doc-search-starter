# Salesforce Omnichannel Inventory Flow Core Actions

Salesforce Omnichannel Inventory provides several core actions for implementing inventory functionality in flows. To add one of these actions to your flow, add an Action element. Then select the **Omnichannel Inventory Service** category, and search for the appropriate action.

|Available in: Lightning Experience|
|Available in: **Enterprise**, **Unlimited**, and **Developer** Editions with Salesforce Omnichannel Inventory|

These actions use Apex-defined input and output variables that map to input and output classes in the Apex ConnectApi namespace. For more information on using Apex-defined variables in flows, see [Considerations for the Apex-Defined Data Type](flow_considerations_apex_data_type.md).

**Important:** A flow that uses Omnichannel Inventory actions must have a runtime API version of 52.0 or later. If possible, always use the latest API version in your flows.
