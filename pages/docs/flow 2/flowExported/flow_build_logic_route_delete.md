# Remove Connectors from a Flow

You can’t modify a connector’s target or source elements, so to change a path, delete the connector and then add a new one.

1.  In your flow, select the connector to delete.

    When you select a connector, its color changes from gray to blue.

2.  Press the DELETE key.


If you delete a connector for a specific outcome, the outcome isn’t deleted from the source element. However, if you delete an outcome from a decision element, the outcome’s connector is also deleted. The same applies to pause configurations.
