With MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\), you can automate business processes that typically require human input and interact with systems that donâ€™t have an API. Use MuleSoft RPA Manager to publish REST APIs for your RPA processes to Anypoint Exchange, which you can then register as external services in Salesforce and invoke from a flow.
