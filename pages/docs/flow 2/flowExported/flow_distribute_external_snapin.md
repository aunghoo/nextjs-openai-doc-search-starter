# Add a Flow to Your Website Using Embedded Service

Embedded flows help your users complete simple, automated tasks from within your website. They're even guest user-friendlyâ€”no login required. Simply create your flow using Flow Builder and add it to an Embedded Service deployment.

Maybe you're an insurance company, and you want to let policyholders search for in-network medical providers without logging in. Or you're an online retailer, and you want to streamline how new customers create accounts. No matter what type of business you run, embedded flows are easily configured to support your customers' most important tasks.
