# Flow Concepts

If you’re new to flows, in need of a review, or just curious, dive in and learn about what a flow is made of and how it’s different from workflow rules.

If you’re new to flows, we recommend walking through the Flow Basics module on **Trailhead**. They’re a great way to learn about flow concepts and discover how flows work.

-   **[../flow/flow\_concepts\_type.md](../flow/flow_concepts_type.md)**  

-   **[../flow/flow\_concepts\_trigger.md](../flow/flow_concepts_trigger.md)**  

-   **[What's the Difference Between Workflow Rules and Flows?](../flow/flow_vs_workflow.md)**  
Salesforce offers several features that automate standard internal procedures and business processes to save time across your org. Despite their similar names, workflow rules and flows are separate Salesforce features for automating business processes.
-   **[Advanced Flow Concepts](../flow/flow_concepts_advanced.md)**  
After you understand the basics, you’re ready for a closer look at what you can do after a flow finishes. Learn what happens when a flow interacts with the Salesforce database, and how flows perform similar operations at the same time. Get to know how a flow test saves you time and improves reliability.
