# Flow Bulkification in Transactions

Programmers can design their code so that similar actions are performed together in one batch. For example, one operation to create 50 records rather than 50 separate operations that each create one record. This process is called bulkification, and it helps your transaction avoid governor limits. If you’re working with flows, you don’t even have to think about bulkification. Flow interviews bulkify actions for you automatically.
