# Route a Flow in Free-Form

In free-form, you create and remove connectors that determine the order of execution for the elements on the canvas.

1.  On the canvas, find the node at the bottom of the source element.

2.  Drag the node onto the target element.

3.  If prompted, select which decision outcome or pause configuration to assign to the path.
