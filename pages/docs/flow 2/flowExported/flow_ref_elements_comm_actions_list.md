# Commerce Checkout Flow Core Actions

The Commerce Checkout Flow provides several core actions for implementing a successful checkout process within your Commerce org. To add one of these actions to your flow, add an Action element. Then select the **Commerce** category, and search for the appropriate action.

These actions use Apex-defined input and output variables that map to input and output classes in the Apex `ConnectApi` namespace. For more information on using Apex-defined variables in flows, see [Considerations for the Apex-Defined Data Type](flow_considerations_apex_data_type.md).
