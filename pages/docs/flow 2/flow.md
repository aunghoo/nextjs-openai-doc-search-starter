[](/s?language=en_US)Flow Builder
=================================

Whether they’re buying movie tickets, paying bills, or changing restaurant reservations, when a customer interacts with a company, they expect a seamless and personalized experience. Flow Builder, formerly Salesforce Flow, provides declarative process automation for every Salesforce app, experience, and portal with point-and-click automation.

    Get to know Flow Builder’s user interface.
*   **[Flow Concepts](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_concepts.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    If you’re new to flows, in need of a review, or just curious, dive in and learn about what a flow is made of and how it’s different from workflow rules.
*   **[Flow Best Practices](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_prep_bestpractices.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    Before you begin building and distributing flows, understand the best practices.
*   **[Build a Flow](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_build.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    After you model the process that you want to automate, design and build the flow in Flow Builder.
*   **[Test a Flow](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_test.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    In Flow Builder, you create, save, and run flow tests. Each time you modify the flow, you can run the test.
*   **[Distribute a Flow](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_distribute.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    Once you’ve designed and tested your flow, it’s time to put it to work! Flows can be executed in several ways, depending on who the flow is designed for. Internal users, external users, or systems can run a flow, or a flow can be deployed for another organization.
*   **[Flow Interviews](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_interviews.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    A flow interview is a running instance of a flow. A flow is an application built by your administrator that asks you for inputs and does something in Salesforce based on those inputs.
*   **[Monitor Flows and Processes](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_monitor.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    Monitor your org’s usage of flows and processes. See a list of paused interviews and scheduled actions from processes. Control who can view and how they view monitoring information for flows and processes.
*   **[Troubleshoot Flows](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_troubleshoot.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    To troubleshoot a failed flow interview, use the flow fault email. To debug the flow and observe what happens as it runs, use the debug option in Flow Builder. To view the failed flow interview in an interactive environment, click **Flow Error: Click here to debug the error in Flow Builder** in the flow fault email.
*   **[Flow Limits and Considerations](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_considerations.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    When designing, managing, and running flows, consider the permissions, use limits, and data issues.
