What Happens When a Flow Finishes?
==================================

By default, when a flow interview that uses screens finishes, a new interview for that flow begins, and the user is redirected to the first screen. To override the default behavior, you can add a local action to your flow. Some distribution methods also offer other ways to override a flowâ€™s finish behavior, such as by setting the `retURL` parameter in a flow URL.

    By default, when a flow finishes, a new interview starts and the user sees the first screen of the flow. To instead redirect the user to another page, build or install a local action that does so. Then add the action to your flow with a Core Action element. For example, a local action can open a record, list view, or URL or to show a toast message. Or it can use the Lightning Console JavaScript API to close a console tab.
