Declaratively configure a flow to run before or after another flow. Order your flows to help ensure consistent results without creating overly complex flows, letting you divide automation by teams or logical owners.

When you save a before- or after-save record-triggered flow, specify a trigger order value from 1 to 2,000. If a flow is already saved, specify a trigger order value in the flowâ€™s version properties.
