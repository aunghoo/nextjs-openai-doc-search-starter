[](/s?language=en_US)Flow Concepts
==================================

If you’re new to flows, in need of a review, or just curious, dive in and learn about what a flow is made of and how it’s different from workflow rules.

*   **[Building Blocks of Flows](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_concepts_building_blocks.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    Use combinations of elements, connectors, and resources to build flows.
*   **[Flow Types](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_concepts_type.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    A flow or flow version’s type determines which elements and resources are supported and the ways that the flow can be distributed.
*   **[Triggers for Autolaunched Flows](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_concepts_trigger.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    In the Start element of an autolaunched flow, you can specify a trigger that launches the flow. The flow trigger can be a schedule or the new and changed records of a specified object. Without a trigger, you must set up other things to launch the flow, such as custom buttons, processes, Apex classes, or even Einstein Bots.
*   **[What's the Difference Between Workflow Rules and Flows?](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_vs_workflow.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    Salesforce offers several features that automate standard internal procedures and business processes to save time across your org. Despite their similar names, workflow rules and flows are separate Salesforce features for automating business processes.
*   **[Advanced Flow Concepts](/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_concepts_advanced.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
    After you understand the basics, you’re ready for a closer look at what you can do after a flow finishes. Learn what happens when a flow interacts with the Salesforce database, and how flows perform similar operations at the same time. Get to know how a flow test saves you time and improves reliability.
